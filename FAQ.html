    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question first">What ages do you teach?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Lessons are available for children as young
          as 2 all the way up to adults. It’s never too early—or too
          late—to learn to swim!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">Do I need to know how to swim before starting lessons?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Not at all! We welcome complete beginners as well as those who
          just want to improve their technique or build confidence in the water.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">How long are the lessons?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Each lesson is 30 minutes for 5 days.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">How many lessons will it take to learn to swim?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Every student learns at their own pace. Some may pick up the
        basics in just a few sessions, while others may benefit from ongoing lessons
        to build confidence and skill.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">Do you offer private or group lessons?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Most lessons are 2-3 swimmers per lesson.
          Private lessons can be arranged. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">What should my child (or I) bring to lessons?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Swimmers wear a swimsuit and bring a towel.
          Goggles can be worn as long as the nose is not covered.
          Hair should be pulled back securely and out of the face.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">What if my child is afraid of the water?</h2>
      <p class="answer">That’s very common, and we specialize in helping children
          and adults feel safe and comfortable at their own pace. We never force skills
          before a swimmer is ready.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="question">Do you offer make-up lessons for missed classes?</h2>
      <p class="answer">Makeups are only scheduled if lessons are cancelled due to
        inclement weather or other conditions making swimming unsafe. </p>
