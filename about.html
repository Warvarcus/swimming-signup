  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Hi, I'm Maria Sims</h2>
  <img src="me1.JPG" alt="teacher with baby">
  <p class="about">I've always believed that swimming is more than just a skill - it's a
      life-saving tool and a source of confidence, joy, and freedom in the water.
      With over 30 years of experience teaching swimmers of all ages, I love
      helping my students go from nervous beginners to confident swimmers.</p>
  <p class="about2">Whether you're looking to learn water safety, improve your
      technique, or simply feel more comfortable in the water, I'll guide you with
      patience, encouragement, and a splash of fun!</p>
  <p class="about3">If you have any questions, you can visit <a href="FAQ.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, or contact me
      via email at: simsswimming@gmail.com</p>
